# IoT-Enabled Packaging Activity Recognition (OpenPack)
**Data Analytics Course - Master in IoT**

## Project Overview
This project implements an analytical solution to automate the recognition of packaging activities in industrial logistics. [cite_start]Using the **OpenPack dataset**, we develop a predictive model that processes data from IoT multimodal sensors (IMU) to reduce human errors and improve traceability in Industry 4.0 environments[cite: 108, 110].

## Problem Statement
[cite_start]Manual packaging tasks often lack real-time monitoring, leading to productivity issues and operational costs[cite: 147, 150]. [cite_start]This project uses AI to bridge that gap[cite: 154].
